BJOLP, The Big Joint Optimal Landmarks Planner uses landmarks to derive an admissible heuristic, which is then used to guide a search for a cost-optimal plan. Landmarks are a common concept in planning, in which a planner seeks to infer facts that must become true at some point in any valid plan. For more information, please see our page on Landmark based search [In Progress].

## Support

BJOLP has not been tested with eviscerator as we could not find source code for the planner, or we couldn't get the source code to compile. BJOLP appears to be targeted to solving classical planning problems, so likely does not support any temporal or numeric features in PDDL.

DAE-YAHSP is a kind of Portfolio planner, which initially starts by allowing YAHSP to attempt to find solutions to a planning problem quickly, before allowing DAE (Divide and Evolve) to take over and optimise the solution. DAE is based on Evolutionary Computation. For more information on the individual components, see their respective pages.

## Support

DAE-YAHSP has not been tested with eviscerator yet. DAE-YAHSP is designed for temporal domains and so most likely does not support numeric planning, it probably supports classical (non-temporal numeric) planning, but is probably less efficient in these domains.

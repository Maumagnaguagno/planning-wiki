Preceded By: -

Alien puts an emphasis on preprocessing and low-level performance. This planner is intended to an alternative framework to The Fast Downward Planning [Link Needed], and gives an emphasis to improved preprocessing stages, code quality, and low-level performance. 

## Support

Alien planner has yet to be successfully tested with Eviscerator, although we believe it is possible and will attempt to conduct a test soon [test needed]. Alien states it is a classical planner in its IPC planner submission so most likely does not support temporal numerics


## Downloading and Compiling Alien Planner

Alien planner source code with a singularity container support can be found as part of a [BitBucket submission](https://bitbucket.org/ipc2018-classical/team33/src/ipc-2018-seq-sat/) to IPC2018

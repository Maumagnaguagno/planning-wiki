Page Contributors: {% git_author %}

Year Published: 2009

Paper: [Temporal Planning in Domains with Linear Processes](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/09/Papers/279.pdf) [ Coles, A. J. Coles, A. I. Fox, M. Long, D.]

Preceded By: Crikey3

COLIN is a forward-chaining heuristic search planner, capable of reasoning with COntinuous LINear numeric change, in addition to the full temporal semantics of PDDL2.1.

## Support

COLIN has not been tested with eviscerator as it has now been superceded by POPF and OPTIC. If you have compiled and tested COLIN on eviscerator, feel free to pull this page and
submit a pull request.


## Downloading and Compiling POPF
[POPF's main KCL Planning page](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/planning/software/colin.html) provides more detail about the COLIN Planner and where the source code can be found.

## Additional Notes
COLIN only supports linear continuous effects, hence the name.

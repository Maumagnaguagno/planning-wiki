Preceded By: -

The C3 Planner is a planner based on the concept of consistent causal chains. These are actions that are clearly sequenced together as they provide or are a precondition of one another.

## Support

C3 has not been tested with eviscerator yet. C3 appears to be targeted to solving classical planning problems, so likely does not support any temporal or numeric features in PDDL.

## Downloading and Compiling C3

Source code for C3 can be found as a [zip](http://icaps-conference.org/ipc2008/deterministic/data/planners/seq-sat-c3.tar.bz2) submitted to the IPC 2008.

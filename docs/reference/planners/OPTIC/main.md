Year Published: 2012

Paper: [Temporal Planning with Preferences and Time-Dependent Continuous Costs](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICAPS/ICAPS12/paper/view/4699/4708) [Benton, J. Coles, A. Coles, A.]

OPTIC is a temporal planner for use in problems where plan cost is determined by preferences or time-dependent goal-collection costs. Such problems arise in a range of interesting situations, from scheduling the delivery of perishable goods, to coordinating order-fulfillment activities in warehouses.

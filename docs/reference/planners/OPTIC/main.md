OPTIC is a temporal planner for use in problems where plan cost is determined by preferences or time-dependent goal-collection costs. Such problems arise in a range of interesting situations, from scheduling the delivery of perishable goods, to coordinating order-fulfillment activities in warehouses.

## Additional Notes
OPTIC has support for linear continuous effects only. This is due to the nature of durative planning in which we can apply constraints over a duration, which cannot be easily verified in non-linear continuous effects.

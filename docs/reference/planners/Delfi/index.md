Delfi is an online portfolio planner. In contrast to existing techniques, Delfi exploits deep learning techniques to learn a model that predicts which of the planners in the portfolio can solve a given planning task within the imposed time and memory bounds. Delfi uses graphical representations of a planning task which allows exploiting existing tools for image convolution

## Support

Delfi has not been tested with eviscerator yet. Delfi is designed for classical domains and so most likely does not support temporal numeric planning.

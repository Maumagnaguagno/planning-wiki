# List of all Planner tags
Planners work in many different ways solving a variety of planning problems. The way the work under-the-hood dictates the types of problem they're capable of handling. In some cases a planner capable of handing classical planning problems has no ability to reason with temporal problems. To help users of this guide find planners that meet their needs, we tag planners with tags related to their abilities and various other notable characteristics. 

The following is a list of tags

tag | Description
----|------------
Classical | Planners which perform classical predicate based planning
Optimal | Planners which perform optimal planning
Bounded Cost | Planners which find search to a bounded cost
Satisficing | Planners which find solutions which satisfy the domain (non-optimal)
Agile | 
Temporal | Planners which plan temporal domains
Numeric | Planners which plan numeric domains
On Board | Planners designed to work on-board low power systems (integrated systems and robotics)
Probabilistic | Planners which perform planning on probabilistic domains

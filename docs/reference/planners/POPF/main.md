# POPF: Partial Order Planning Forwards

Page Contributors: {% git_author %}

Year Published: 2010

Paper: [Forward-Chaining Partial-Order Planning](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICAPS/ICAPS10/paper/view/1421/1527) [ Coles,A. J. Coles, A. I. Fox, M. Long, D.]

Preceded By: COLIN, Crikey3

POPF is forwards-chaining temporal planner. Its name derives from the fact that it incorporates ideas from partial-order planning â€” during search, when applying an action to a state, it seeks to introduce only the ordering constraints needed to resolve threats, rather than insisting the new action occurs after all of those already in the plan. Its implementation is built on that for the planner COLIN, and it retains the ability to handle domains with linear continuous numeric effects.

## Downloading and Compiling POPF

[POPF's main KCL Planning page](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/planning/software/popf.html) provides more detail about the POPF Planner and where the source code can be found.

## Additional Notes

POPF only supports linear continuous effects

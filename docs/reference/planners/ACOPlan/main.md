Preceded By: -

ACOPlan is a planner based on the ant colony optimization framework, in which a colony of planning ants searches for near optimal solution plans with respect to an overall plan cost metric. This approach is motivated by the strong similarity between the process used by artificial ants to build solutions and the methods used by stateâ€“based planners to search solution plans. Planning ants perform a stochastic and heuristic based search by interacting through a pheromone model.

## Support

ACOPlan has not been tested with eviscerator as we could not find source code for the planner, or we couldn't get the source code to compile. ACOPlan appears to be targeted to solving classical planning problems, so likely does not support any temporal or numeric features in PDDL.

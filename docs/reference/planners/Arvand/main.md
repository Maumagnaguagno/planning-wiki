Preceded By: Fast Downward

Arvand is a stochastic planner that uses Monte Carlo random walks (MRW) planning to balance exploration and exploitation in heuristic search. Arvand is built on top of the Fast Downward Planning System [link needed]

## Support

Arvand has not been tested with eviscerator as we could not find source code for the planner, or we couldn't get the source code to compile. Arvand appears to be targeted to solving classical planning problems, so likely does not support any temporal or numeric features in PDDL.

## Downloading and Compiling Arvand

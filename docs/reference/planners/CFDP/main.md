Preceded By: FDP

CFDP is a planning system based on the paradigm of planning as constraint satisfaction, that searches for cost optimal plans. It uses an Iterative Deepening Depth First Search procedure. CFDP works directly on a structure related to Graphplanâ€™s planning graph: given a fixed bound on the length of the plan, the structure is incrementally build. Each time the structure is extended, a search for cost-optimal sequential plans is made.

## Support

CFDP has not been tested with eviscerator yet. Fast Downward forms the base planner of CFDP, please refer to the Fast Downward [Link Needed] page for an idea of the supported features in this planner

## Downloading and Compiling CFDP

CFDP planner source code can be downloaded as a [Zip](http://icaps-conference.org/ipc2008/deterministic/data/planners/C-fdp.pdf) based on its submission to IPC 2008

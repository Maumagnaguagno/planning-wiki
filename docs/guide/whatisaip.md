# What is AI Planning?
## Introduction
AI Planning is a field of Artificial Intelligence which explores the process of using autonomous techniques to solve planning and scheduling problems. A planning problem is one in which we have some initial starting state, which we wish to transform into a desired goal state through the application of a set of actions.

In a simple example, imagine we wish to build a house. On our building site we can assume all the materials are ready to be used and we essentially now have to decide which order to perform construction in. Each step of construction in this situation could be modelled as an action (for example laying foundations, building the walls, installing the plumbing and electricals etc.). 

Certain actions cannot happen before others - we cannot build a wall before we have a foundation - so through the use of predicate logic we can express this problem by saying "if there is no foundation, we cannot build a wall". 

AI planning can leverage this form of expression in order to solve this problem and others. Of course in reality planning the construction of a house is not particularly difficult, but imagine instead we were planning the construction of an Olympic stadium. The same problem can be broken down into similar simple tasks which are dependent on priot conditions being met
